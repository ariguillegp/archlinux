# Arch Linux Installation Guide - 2020

This document is a guide for installing Arch Linux using the live system booted from an installation medium made from an official installation image.

Arch Linux should run on any x86_64-compatible machine with a minimum of 512 MiB RAM, though more memory is needed to boot the live system for installation. A basic installation should take less than 2 GiB of disk space. As the installation process needs to retrieve packages from a remote repository, this guide assumes a working internet connection is available.
